# workflow-node.js-server-view.and.data.api test suite

The tests have been designed to run locally and via a service like [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/).


### Setup
When you test locally, you can use any of the setup option describe in the [main readme](../README.md), but when the test
are ran on the Travis service site, you need to use system variables to define your credential keys in your Travis project settings
(Settings -> Environment Variables)

Define a CONSUMERKEY and CONSUMERSECRET system variables with the keys given to you on the
[Autodesk Developer portal](https://developer.autodesk.com/)

When you run locally, make sure to execute 'npm install --dev' as well. This command will download and install the
required node modules for developers automatically for you.
These modules are only required for the tests to run on your local machine.<br />
```
npm install --dev
```

### Create a test data set
In order to test some of the API in the sample, we need some data to be pre-created on your account. Since the data set will
be created in a perment bucket, you need to do that step only once. You can either create the data set using this sample before
running the tests, or use any of the other examples posted on our
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/Developer-Autodesk?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=workflow).

Post the samples/Au.obj file in a permanent bucket named 'autotestpermament' + your consumer key in lowercase.
For example, if my consumer key is 'pc3fr7BzWdaCkAzr3G6RGFgfNwpOyA65', the bucket name will be: <br />
```
autotestpermamentpc3fr7bzwdackazr3g6rgfgfnwpoya65
```

You can also change the prefix bucket name by editing the support/env.js.

### Run the test
On [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), it is launched automatically.

On your local machine, run the following command: <br />
```
npm test
```
